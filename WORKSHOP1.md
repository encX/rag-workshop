# Workshop 1: Let's build a simple chatbot

Generate a API token from [OpenAI's dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and set it to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in `.env`.

Then, run the following command to start the chatbot UI.

```bash
fastapi dev chatbot
```

Now, try the chatbot at `http://localhost:8000`.
